\begin{center}\textbf{Acknowledgements}\end{center}

\noindent First, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof. Amiya Nayak for his continuous support, motivation, advice and immense knowledge throughout my thesis work. I could not have imagined having a better mentor for my Master's study.

Also, I would like to thank my family and friends, especially Yichao Lin, for providing me with unfailing support and encouragement throughout the process of researching and writing my thesis. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you.
